<p>Module 4 of MAPmaker is a turning point.</p> 
<p>In Module 1 you assessed your current situation and dared to envision a more positive future for yourself.  In Module 2 you inventoried all of your influences and engaged in thoughtful self-reflection to differentiate your personal values and beliefs from those of others around you. In Module 3 you delved deeply into your most authentic self to acknowledge and embrace your greatest personal desires.</p> 
<p>You must be exhausted! </p>
<p>(But hopefully you are also enlivened with self-awareness, honesty, curiosity, and an enlarged sense of your personal possibility).</p> 
<p>In this module we will transition from deep, inwardly focused introspection, to begin focusing on how our authentic self can more optimally engage in the outward world around us.</p>

Which core feelings and experiences are most important to providing you with personal senses of the <i>meaning</i> in your life?

Name some <i>things beyond yourself</i> that you could serve if you lived with more of your core feelings and experiences.
<br><br>
List the areas of <i>personal growth</i> that will enable your life to be more filled with the core feelings and experiences you desire.
<br><br>
List which <i>relationships</i> that you either currently have or need to develop in the future (to any influence, such as people, groups, practices, experiences, etc.) are most important to supporting your life being lived with more of your core feelings and experiences.

List any areas of <i>engagement</i> or <i>mastery</i> (either in your life’s work or avocationally) that would provide you with more of your core feelings and experiences.`

export const QUES_450_DESC = `Listing your desires is an important first step, one that can be hard. But there is more to do here. The next step is to go through a process of filtering that will allow you to decide which desires are most important to you within each category.
<br><br>
Within each category, compare the desires you listed, and make a tradeoff between each set of two, choosing only one of the two desires to carry into the next round.  For example, if you listed ten desires in one category, then compare your first listed desire to your second listed desire, and choose only one of them.  Then do the same for desires three and four, etc… At the end of round 1 you will have culled your desires in this category from ten to five.  Then do the same in the next round, and so on, until you only have one primary desire within the category.  Do this exercise for all seven categories until you only have one primary desire for each category.
<br><br>
This exercise has two main aims.
<br><br>
First, and most basically, it allows you to identify and focus on your deepest, most compelling desires, while letting other secondary desires fall to the sidelines. That will be valuable for developing your sense of purpose, since purpose is inherently based on what is most meaningful to you. Seeing what you choose as your most compelling desires, as well as seeing what you don’t choose, can help you to know what you are most striving for among a field of possible options.
<br><br>
Second, and more deeply, this exercise will give you an opportunity to be visceral rather than logical or reasonable, to sit in your body and feel your way through what is most important to you. Purpose is not something you reason your way into. The logic you use may very well stem from the unacknowledged expectations of others. Purpose takes root when you find yourself committed to something almost despite the better reasons one could find for taking another path. If the path makes sense to you, it has to make sense on the level of the heart, not just the head. As the philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote, 'The heart has reasons which the reason knows not.'
<br><br>
<i>A caveat:<i> when you get down to your last few desires, you may find that they are equally important, and you may want to combine some of them to come up with an optimal final desire. There will be an opportunity for you to make this kind of revision in the last two rounds.`


export const QUES_460_DESC = `When you are finished, you will be able to see all of your final desires for each category in one place. Think about them for a few minutes. Taken together, what do they suggest about the life that you desire? Also think about how you prioritized each category in your second tradeoff exercise. In the space provided, write a short statement that brings together all the desires from each category and captures the essence of what this exercise has revealed to you, using the phrases themselves. As you organize the statement, pay attention to how you prioritized among these desires.`
