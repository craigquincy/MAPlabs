export const MOD_4_DESC = `Module 4 of MAPmaker is a turning point. <br>
<br>
In Module 1 you assessed your current situation and dared to envision a more positive future for yourself.  In Module 2 you inventoried all of your influences and engaged in thoughtful self-reflection to differentiate your personal values and beliefs from those of others around you. In Module 3 you delved deeply into your most authentic self to acknowledge and embrace your greatest personal desires.
You must be exhausted! 
<br><br>
(But hopefully you are also enlivened with self-awareness, honesty, curiosity, and an enlarged sense of your personal possibility).
In this module we will transition from deep, inwardly focused introspection, to begin focusing on how our authentic self can more optimally engage in the outward world around us.

export const QUES_410_DESC = `Take the VIA Survey of Character Strengths. The survey is available for free on the
University of Pennsylvania’s Positive Psychology Center website. This link will take you there
directly, or you can go to www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu , hover over the
“Questionnaires” menu item, and click on the VIA Survey of Character Strengths (make sure
to take the standard, adult version, not the “children” version). The explanations of strengths
on this website are brief, but if you would like more in-depth information, you can take the
same survey for free on the VIA Institute of Character website, but then pay $40 for their
VIA Pro Report which gives a more robust explanation of both your individual strengths, as
well as how they interplay with each other. See an example of the VIA Pro Report here .
Before taking the survey, you’ll need to create an account and login.
Some details about the Survey:
<br><br>
It has 240 short statements about personal qualities you may have. Your task will be
to indicate on a 5-point scale how well each statement describes you. There is no time
limit, so you can reflect on each question as long as you like. However, the questions
are designed to be answered rapidly, and typically people need about 30 minutes to
finish.
<br><br>
As with any survey of this kind, there are no right or wrong answers.
When you complete the survey, the site will compile your answers and return a
ranked list of your character strengths.
Please note: Initially, the University of Pennsylvania site will only show your top 5
“signature strengths,” but at the very bottom of the page, under “Strength #5,” click
on the words “Show More” to reveal the ranking of all 24 of your strengths. There is
a lot to learn from which strengths are not your top strengths!
Study your strengths. Now that you have discovered your strengths, familiarize yourself
with them. The strengths survey results will provide a basic definition of each strength.
Since these strengths are considered to be foundational to who you are, what you value, and
ultimately how you can build a more meaningful and purposeful life, it is important that you
take some time to fully understand your signature strengths.
We highly recommend that you read the more comprehensive definitions about your
strengths for free on the VIA Institute of Character’s site here ,
( http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths ) where you can click on each
pictured strength to reveal a whole page on each.

export const QUES_420_DESC = `Now, reflect broadly and generally on each of the strengths you listed in the field provided. The goal for the remainder of today is to simply get you thinking about what these strengths
are and whether you have seen them surface in your life. To help you reflect on them, here
are some prompts:`


export const QUES_430_DESC = `Now we want to make this exploration of strengths more concrete. Rather than focusing on strengths generally, consider how or when each strength manifests itself in your everyday life, past and present. Note how and when in your current life or in your past you used your top strengths with satisfaction or good results? It is also possible, for example, that your top strengths find little opportunity for expression in your current life or career, whereas your normal duties require strengths that are far down your list. If this is the case, then note how and when you do use your top strengths, even if they are just a small part of your everyday life.
This will be an exercise in two parts. For each strength, list its “embodiments” and “impediments” in your life. 
<br><br>
An embodiment is a task, a practice, or an experience in your life that calls upon your strength. You may have previously just thought of such embodiments in isolation as things you are good at, that are easy for you, or that cause you to experience flow when you are doing them. But by seeing these experiences as embodiments of a character strength, you can begin to understand how these strengths have served as personal equities or special talents that are expressive of who you are authentically, your natural self. By listing as many examples as you can of how your signature strengths are embodied in your life, you can view your strengths more holistically, and see how and when they have impact in your life (as well as where and when they are missing). 
<br><br>
An impediment is something about your circumstances, yourself, or others that prevents you from acting on your strength. Your circumstances, yourself, or others could be downright hostile to your strength, but an impediment need not be so extreme. It could just be that the conditions of success in your circumstances, or the attitudes of yourself and others, steer you away from acting on your core strengths. As with the embodiments, try to list as many examples as you can of when and how your signature strengths are impeded in your life so that you can view your life more holistically, and see how and when your strengths have been impeded from enabling you to live a more fully authentic and natural life.
<br><br>
There is no timeframe that should limit your selection of embodiments and impediments. Something that comes to mind from ten or twenty years ago is just as eligible as something from ten minutes ago. Odds are, patterns you might notice in the distant past still manifest themselves, however subtly, in your life today.
<br><br>
One final note, sometimes your strengths demonstrate both embodiment and impediment in the same circumstance. We may actually find ourselves in circumstances that both embody and impede our strengths. In this case, please capture it in both categories. Here’s an example to help you get started:
In the sample VIA Pro Report that you can see here, one of Jo’s strengths is creativity. Jo found both embodiments and impediments to this strength in a consulting career. Embodiments were the challenges of coming up with fresh ideas to solve a client’s problem, the senses of flow experienced when developing the creative ideas, and the rewards gained from cleverly succeeding in “the chess game” of business. Impediments were that this creativity was sharply constrained to only commercial applications, which caused personal conflicts, and even a sense of personal deadening, in not using this creative strength in ways that better supported the non-commercial values, beliefs and desires that were most important.,  A sense of “golden handcuffs” was felt at not being able to step away from the commercial success that the creativity brought, in order to use the creativity in something that would be more personally valued and that would lead to a more fulfilling life.
