export default `Welcome to Module 3, in which you will explore your deep, authentic desires.
<br><br>
Desire plays an important role in well-being. In Module 3 we will focus on differentiating between inauthentic desires, which we appropriate from the influences and distractions around us, and our authentic ones, which we source from our deepest selves.
<br><br>
In Module 1 we differentiated between our current situation, which may have resulted from extrinsic motivations, and our desired future life, which can be built on intrinsic motivations.
<br><br>
In Module 2, a primary takeaway was that often our inhibiting values and beliefs make their way into our lives through the relational, social, and cultural influences around us. These “adopted” values and beliefs can make us feel like we desire things (or should, at any rate) that actually lead to our dissatisfying current situation. Often this is because these extrinsic desires are not coming from our authentic, intrinsic values and beliefs.
<br><br>
In Module 3 we will continue our process by building on the intrinsic values and beliefs that we identified in Module 2 to help lead us to the deepest desires we have for our lives across a battery of life elements.`
