export const MOD_5_DESC = `Each of the previous modules walked you through specific elements that build and nourish a
life of meaning and purpose. This final module takes everything that you have completed and pulls it together to help
 you to create both a clarifying
life purpose statement and a set of commitments and goals that can direct your actions
toward achieving your purpose.
<br><br>
There is a lot more to purpose than simply writing an inspirational
sentence and posting it on the wall. Such statements have value only when they
encapsulate a deep well of self-knowledge gained through reflection. They
serve as a useful shorthand that can be internalized and used as a guide through our
everyday activities, helping us to remain focused on what truly matters to us.
<br><br>
We will approach the task of articulating a purpose statement by developing a MAPmaker
Dashboard. This will compile the most critical information created in MAPmaker thus far.
The Dashboard will not only provide a context of self-understanding, but it will also provide a quick-reference guide to
which you can return after completing the MAPmaker
program.
<br><br>
Module 5 develops the framework of your life purpose in four phases. Each
phase is built from all of the work completed in Modules 1 through 4.
<br><br>
The first phase will establish the context of your purpose-seeking life by grounding you in a
solid understand of where you are, where you want to go, and the key
meaning and purpose themes that you discovered and articulated throughout the previous
four modules.
<br><br>
The second will focus on the “who”. Who you are based on the personal elements that
you examined and articulated in the previous modules: your personal sense of meaning;
your greatest desires, which arise out of your sense of meaning; and your signature
strengths. These three elements represent who you are innately based on your values and
beliefs, your deepest emotions, and your aptitudes and abilities. It is important that your
sustainable sense of life purpose be rooted in the intrinsics of who you are, not in the
extrinsic forces and influences around you. That’s why Module 5 grounds you in your
authentic “who”.
<br><br>
The third phase will focus on the “what,” that is, what you care about most that is beyond
yourself. Lives of well-being, meaning, and purpose are not isolated, egotistical, or
solipsistic. We are all social beings who live in relation to other friends and family, cultures
and societies, and broader ideas and values. In fact, as mentioned in earlier modules,
positive relationships are the number one indicator of well-being. So the third phase will
seek to connect what you care about most that is beyond yourself, with your most authentic
self that you focused on in the second phase.
<br><br>
Establishing your context, acknowledging who you are, and articulating what you care about
beyond yourself are the core elements of human purpose. After naming these, you will be
able to form your own life purpose statement.
<br><br>
The fourth phase will focus on the “how.” Here we consider how you will prepare yourself to
implement your sense of purpose by leveraging two additional elements of life purpose, your
commitments and goals. Every purpose statement implies a practical orientation, a way we
intend to act in the world. Commitments are the heart of that intention, because
implementing purpose can be hard, full of temptations along the way to drift into a path of
<br><br>
least resistance. Commitment implies both a specific scope of action and a will to stay the
course. You will likely revise your sense of purpose through experimentation along the way,
but commitments ensure that the changes you make are deliberate, rather than reactive.
<br><br>
With commitments in place, goals focus on how you will make good on your commitments
on an everyday basis. They translate your intention to act into step-by-step execution.
Congratulations on coming this far! For all the effort we exert in our various life tasks, very
few people engage in the kind of self reflection that you have over the last four modules. We
hope that this will be only a jumpstart in a lifelong journey toward purpose, but having
worked through MAPmaker, you will have the core tools you need to make progress on your
own.`

export const QUES_540_DESC = `Our lives are
most purposeful when a few things hold true: 
<br>
(1) we know what is most meaningful to us, 
<br>
(2) our desires arise out of this meaning, 
<br>
(3) we fulfill our desires through our personal
strengths, and
<br>
(4) we apply our strengths in service of something or someone beyond
ourselves. 
<br><br>
In modules 1 - 4, you worked through a process of separating yourself from all the extrinsic
influences that have fought for your attention all of your life. This allowed you to discover
what is most intrinsically meaningful to you. From this place of self-understanding, you then
worked through the trade-off exercise to discover what you most deeply desire. Then you
took the VIA Survey of Character Strengths to understand which strengths you possess to
animate your meaning and accomplish your desires. 
<br><br> 
All along, you considered how your
meaning, desires, and strengths could apply to something beyond yourself. Your Dashboard now contains many elements of a purposeful life: the thematic elements
that give your life a context, your grounded sense of what is most meaningful to you, your
awareness and articulation of what you desire most, a list of your greatest strengths, and
your outward-looking understanding of how these things can be channeled toward service
beyond yourself. These elements can help you to articulate how to live your life more
purposefully. 
<br><br>
It is now time for you to bring these elements together into a purpose statement.
Take some time to consider all of the elements on your Dashboard. Then articulate your own
personal life purpose statement based on how who you are can meaningfully connect to
what you care about in order to better serve yourself and something beyond yourself. 
<br><br> 
Complete the following statement in the most authentic and precise way you can:
My life is most meaningful when I experience or embrace ___(source[s] of meaning)__. That is why my greatest desire is to ___(desire)__ by using my ___(strengths)___ in
service of _(something or someone beyond the self)_. `

// export const QUES_550_DESC = `Review and revise your Current Situation statement`

export const QUES_550_DESC = `Now that you have articulated a life purpose statement, it is time to begin working on how it
can materialize in your life. <br><br>
Focus on commitment. You may recall that commitment is another one of the core
elements of the definition of purpose. At this point in your purpose journey, you may have
discovered something to which you have been committed for a long time and just never
realized it—or you may now have new insights that you did not have before about how you
can direct your life to make it more meaningful and purposeful. Either way, commitment to
developing your purpose (even when you do not know exactly how to execute it) is the
critical next step.
<br><br>
In order to progress from stating a life purpose, as you did in Exercise 4, to implementing
your life of purpose, you will benefit from having a few specific commitments to which you
are dedicated for the long term. By creating commitments out of the most important
elements of personal growth, relationships, and engagement mastery that you developed in
the previous modules, you will begin to architect your life into one that is capable of
manifesting your life purpose, and seeing it through in a committed way.
<br><br>
The challenge in this section is to narrow your commitments down to only the most critical
and salient efforts that will help you build toward your life purpose. For many people, this
means having the clarity to choose just one primary commitment to which they are single-
mindedly dedicated. For others, this may mean having two or three commitment areas that
they need to further develop in order to be prepared or equipped to fulfill their purpose. But
having too many commitments leads to too much diffusion of effort, and often leads to both
a sense of being overwhelmed by how much there is to do, and to not seeing enough near-
term progress on any one measure or initiative to develop positive momentum for one’s
purpose.
<br><br>
Exercise 5 A, B, and C will lead you through a process of establishing your primary
commitment(s). This process will anchor your efforts in your personal growth
commitments, and then help you to attach to these commitments the relationships and
masteries that are needed to see them through. As a result, your primary commitments will
be multidimensional, contextualized by your relationships (existing and new), and well-
supported by both your personal growth and your developing senses of mastery in order to
give them greater definition and a greater chance of success.
<br><br>
All that said, we do want to offer one caveat: if, as you go through this process, you discover
that other important commitments arise out of your relationships or engagement masteries
that are different from the ones that arose out of your personal growth, you will have the
opportunity to add them onto your dashboard as “other” commitments so that you have the
flexibility to customize your commitments. Later, we will encourage you to make them
multidimensional, contextualized, and supported by attaching them to the other types of
commitments (i.e., personal growth, relationships, or engagement masteries) just as you will
have done with the personal growth commitments in Exercise 5A.`

export const QUES_560_DESC = `
<br><br>
The fourth and final core element of the definition of purpose is
goal-orientation. You wrote your life purpose statement by articulating how you will use
your meaning, desire, and strengths to serve something beyond yourself. You then
articulated how you will commit to building your purpose through personal growth,
relationships, and engagement mastery. Now it is time to become even more concrete
through listing specific goals that will support a life centered on your purpose.
As you develop your goals here, try to write them in a way that is both 
<br><br>(1) specific and 
<br><br>
(2) challenging. 
<br> <br>
Organizational psychologists Edwin Locke and Gary Latham have studied goal-
setting over many years and identified these as the two elements of goals that bring about the
most dramatic results. And it makes intuitive sense. There is little use in striving for
something if you cannot say what it is that you are striving for. And if you are not challenged,
achieving the goal may not bringing out the very best in you—not to mention that achieving
the goal would leave you in a position not very different from the one you started from.
<br><br>
The idea recalls what we discussed in Module 3 about “flow,” the experience of rising to a
challenge that brings us up to the outer limit of our strengths. Let your goal-setting create a
context for you to experience flow on a daily basis.`

export const QUES_570_DESC = `In an article entitled, “Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change,” and
then later in her book The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, demonstrates how
research shows that our degree of life satisfaction is determined by 3 critical elements.
About 50% of our life satisfaction is based on our personality “set point,” that is, who we are
when we come into this life in terms of our genetic make-up and our innate aptitudes and
strengths. While we cannot fundamentally change our set points, we can certainly do a lot to
influence whether they are working for us or against us. With clear self-knowledge, we can
set up our lives to live in ways that give us the joy of harmonizing with our set point
characteristics, and that allow us to more naturally feel the flow of a life that synchronizes
with who we are organically. But unfortunately, without clear self-knowledge, many of us live
in ways that battle against our set point characteristics, making our lives a struggle against
our most authentic natures.
<br><br>
Throughout the last four modules, you have spent many hours gaining clarity about your
authentic nature. You have considered which influences in your life are supportive of, and
which are inhibitive to, your deepest self, just as you have examined your top strengths to
understand who you are most predisposed to be. Your investment in this self-knowledge will
serve to ground you in the elements of your self that are set so that you can harmonize with
them instead of fighting against them.
<br><br>
The second element of life satisfaction, and the one most of us consider when thinking about
changing our lives, is our circumstances. Perhaps we think that a new job will change things. 
Or we may feel that new possessions, such as cars, houses, or more income, will provide us
with more happiness. Or maybe we try even more drastic changes, such as new relationships
or moving to an entirely new place, in order to help us transform our lives. While
circumstances do have impact, according to Lyubomirsky, research shows that changing our
circumstances only impacts our life satisfaction by about 10%.
<br><br>
Like many others in her field, Lyubomirsky references studies that compare new lottery
winners to recent paraplegic suffers. The shocking findings of these studies show that while
lottery winners experience very elevated highs immediately after winning, and paraplegic
sufferers experience very depressed lows immediately following their misfortunes, one year
later both the lottery winners and the paraplegic suffers return to essentially the same state
of life satisfaction that they experienced prior to their transformative events. Researchers
have come to realize that the impacts of circumstances are relatively short-lived, and then we
soon adjust our expectations and experiences of satisfaction to whatever “new normal” we
have created. Perhaps you have heard of the term “hedonic adaptation,” which describes this
exact phenomenon.
<br><br>
Much of your work over the past four modules gave you insights into the circumstances you
have tried in the past so that you have real-life, circumstantial experiences to use as a
personal guide to judging where you felt harmony in your life experiences, and where you did
not. From writing about your current situation, to considering how your strengths have been
either embodied or impeded by your circumstances, you have a considerable audit of the
situations that have served you and those that have not.
<br><br>
Between examining the elements of your personality set point, and auditing your past for
insights about the types of circumstances that are most beneficial to you, you have a solid
foundation of self-knowledge and strong reference points for making life decisions.
But if 50% of life satisfaction is determined by your innate set point, and 10% is influenced
by circumstances, what is the other 40%? We’re glad you asked, because the other 40% is
what Lyubomirsky says is your greatest lever of “sustainable change,” and it is the result of
intentional actions. In discussing this final 40%, Lyubomirsky did not just say intentions, because intentions
alone without actions do not manifest, and therefore they do not impact your life. She also
did not just say actions, because actions on their own without being grounded in considered
intentions are just activity, but not necessarily pointed in an intended direction. The phrase
intentional actions includes personal consideration, self-understanding, motive, design, and
volition, combined with effort, embodiment and implementation. Intentional actions are
rooted in your self-considered desires, and proactively move you and your life to where you
want to go.
<br><br>
Again, much of the work you did over the past four modules was designed to give you the
insights and self-understanding to develop a sense of your intentions, as well as clarity about
the types of actions you would need to enact in order to see your intentions begin to manifest
in your life. From naming your deepest desires, to articulating how you want these to
manifest in your relationships and environmental mastery, to listing what you need to break
from and build toward, you now have an understanding of what you want, an articulation of
how you intend to manifest your wants, and guidelines to assist you in acting on these to
impact your life.
<br><br>
As MAPmaker comes to a conclusion, we want to congratulate you on the boldness and selfadvocacy that you have evidenced in completing this program. Very few people have
engaged in a process that is as deep or concentrated on self-understanding as the process
you have just completed. Today, you stand on new ground with the self-awareness to enact
the changes and transformations necessary to build toward a life of meaning-based purpose.
We hope that as you step into the opportunity to proactively shape your future life, that you
will use your Dashboard as a constant reminder of your most important self-discoveries, and
your MAPPERS Model to help you live out your personal narrative.
<br><br>
Our goal is to continually innovate around MAPmaker, and to grow the platform as new
users help to understand how the program was effective, and what additional resources they
would like for us to develop in the future. So please stay in touch with us, help us to
understand how the program impacted you, what additional needs you have, what future
programs or resources you would like for us to develop to facilitate your next phases of
meaning and purpose development.
<br><br>
And if you feel that your life benefitted from the MAPmaker program, please let others know.
We will only be able to serve the world’s populations in their ongoing search for meaning and
purpose if we attract enough users to make our work viable. We will willingly accept any
assistance you can provide, whether by passing along the MAPmaker link to someone you
know, posting about us on social media, or lending one of your strengths or areas of
expertise to our team to help us reach the next phase of our purpose.`
