export default `Meaning and purpose, at bottom, arise from kinds of self-knowledge.  They embody the living, active knowledge of what matters most to us.  They make sense of the world around us and how we fit into it.  And they direct us toward the unique contribution we hope to make to ourselves, others, and the world around us.
<br><br>
This has a practical implication for those of us who want a deeper sense of meaning and purpose: deep reflection must become part of our everyday lives.
<br><br>
What do we mean by “deep reflection”?  It is a practice of stepping back from the immediate claims on our attention, looking inward, observing our patterns of thought and feeling, asking why we think and feel as we do, and developing insight from that line of questioning about who we are most authentically.
<br><br>
That’s hard.
<br><br>
The ancient philosopher Socrates described self-knowledge as an elusive, but critical component of how one should live.  In modern times, scientists echo this sentiment in listing “thoughtful self-reflection” as a foundational element of developing life meaning and purpose.  As you will see, every module within MAPmaker offers exercises designed to provoke thoughtful self-reflection, and your willingness and efforts to engage in thoughtful self-reflections will in large measure determine  how successful you are in creating life transformation.
<br><br>
Most of us are afraid of what we will find when we truly know ourselves.  Or perhaps we are afraid of not finding much at all.  At any rate, our everyday lives are usually so full of distractions and claims on our attention and emotional energy that deep reflection is exceedingly rare.  MAPmaker gives you both a context and a methodology to evolve beyond this avoidance, and to embrace who you are at your deepest, most authentic self.
<br><br>
You will be doing a lot of reflection throughout MAPmaker (one of its long-term benefits for you, in fact, may be a habit of reflection that continues long after you are finished).  The purpose of this introductory module is to ease you into the program by offering exercises that help you to 1) reflect on your current life situation, and 2) think about how you would like your situation to change in the future.
